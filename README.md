# About me

I recently found my true calling as a developer after a career as a project coordinator. I am passionate about JavaScript and seek a deeper understanding of programming languages. At the same time I want to provide a good user experience. It is important to me that my work has meaning and improves peoples' lives.

Iâ€™m currently improving my JavaScript Skills here:<br>
